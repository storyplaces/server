Forgive me, perhaps I should have made this point altogether more pellucid when first we met at The Tudor House in Bugle Street, but I hoped our initial meeting place might have curtailed this somewhat predictable, if you do not mind my saying so, expectation of yours. And so now I find myself in the detestable position of having to warn you that, once you leave the bus-stop where now you stand (beneath its shelter if it is raining and you continue to possess the sense you were born with), you will be journeying back in time, from the year 1912 to the year 1895.

Perhaps, dear reader, you may be a gentleman in your thirties, with sandy-coloured hair and an impressive moustache, sporting a navy blue jacket and pale grey trousers. If so, I suspect Emily sought your hand because you reminded her of her father - a consequence of wishful thinking rather than mistaken identity. You may scan the thousand-strong crowd assembled on Canute Road to look for her. You wish you had not let go of her hand because you want to assure her, as your natural instinct dictates, that all may still be well. But of the 724 crew members from Southampton, only 175 survived the sinking to return home. I wish I could assure you that Emily's father is among them, but I cannot construct that happy ending just to please you. You may in the end come to regard me as an unreliable narrator, but you certainly shall not consider me a dishonest one.

This is a story propelled by legs rather than by any other form of locomotion with which you might be familiar.

For weeks, he watched Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly go about their ‘immoral' business in the dark alleyways of Whitechapel. And from his room on Lamb street, he pictured himself ridding the streets of their filthy ways by mutilating and then murdering them before he actually got round to doing it.

Jack, spurred into action with a nudge from John Doling, now hefts the memorial stone into place.) <br/><br/>Annie: ‘It is with great pleasure that I declare this memorial stone well and truly laid.' <br/><br/>(Everybody claps and Jack suffers a coughing fit. Could he have consumption?) <br/><br/>John Doling: ‘Three Cheers for Mrs Yorke.' <br/><br/>(Hip, hip, hooray etc. etc.) <br/><br/> John Doling: ‘Three Cheers for his…' <br/><br/> (I think we'll leave them at this juncture, dear reader, don't you?)",

The ground floor comprises dining hall, kitchen and reading room. You'll find the dormitories (and washrooms) on the first, second and third floors. Each dormitory provides beds for seventy potential emigrants. Each emigrant has a cubic space of 350 feet. (Should you wish to reproduce this degree of confinement the equivalent space can be found in the rear of a Ford Transit Van). Assuming mathematics is not your forte, 3 dormitories, multiplied by 70 emigrants, equals 210 emigrants. However, if you count the ones with long beards snoozing in their dirty coats on the concrete floor of the basement, the total number of emigrants seeking shelter here at any one time totals a good deal more. The system of inlet and outlet ventilation is second to none and if you continue to doubt it, I shall not hesitate to prove it to you with the requisite facts and figures. The Sanitary arrangements are rather novel, not to mention popular, since they flush all excreta away, (Jack for one always takes care to leave his crap at work and I don't blame him. In a different context, I do too). In short, dear reader, what more could an emigrant desire? ‘Warmth and security while they await the ship to take them to the new world,' you say. Hmm, the boiler in the basement and the steam pipes elsewhere, keep all animal life here warm.",

So many times I've wanted to take you to a place at night but my better judgement has intervened to keep you safe. Well, no more, dear reader. You must grace Queen's Park after hours to understand why the city of Southampton needed an Emigrants' Home. Furthermore, you must summon your imagination and view this park, not as you know it (i.e. as a beautiful and tranquil place that facilitates lazy endeavours), but as the countless number of homeless emigrants who slept here in 1893, knew it. (If you find this difficult, I suggest you briefly return to 2016 and google the migrant camp in Calais nicknamed, ‘The Jungle.') In 1893, this park is barren except for the memorial to Chinese Gordon which has served for months as a reliable centre pole in that makeshift tent you see yonder, but the roof does let in the rain. If you ask that man over there - the one trying to get that meagre pile of wood aflame to warm his wife and frostbitten children - the name by which this park is known, he'll tell you it's, ‘The Number One Open Air Hotel' and not ‘Queen's Park.' Here, disease is rife, crime is too, and children witness things no child should. That's why John Doling built the Emigrants' Home.",

Pity, but you missed her arrival at Southampton Docks Station. For the spotty baggage porter at least, it was quite the event. The beauty of her particular otherworldliness touched him most intimately and rendered him speechless. His inability to offer any baggage-carrying assistance to the great and the good elsewhere on the platform caused the station master's peptic ulcer to flare up. It didn't help that Golda and the other emigrants  seemed incapable of locating the exit. (Of course neither the station master nor the porter had any Russian or Yiddish, and neither Golda nor any of the others spoke a word of English. Lucky for you, dear reader, I read  thoughts as well as speaking English, police-speak and rubbish, so will be able to transcribe all that transpires in Golda's mind perfectly well.) It required a series of explicit gestures (and if you press me for further details, not all of them polite) for the station master to rid his kingdom of these emigrants. And this is where you meet Golda now, outside the station on Terminus Terrace, just after a gang of vagabonds has swaggered past her roaring, ‘Down with the Jews! Down with the Jews!' - which, incidentally, reminds me of the words Jack daubed on a Whitechapel wall minutes after he'd murdered Catherine Eddowes, ‘The Jewes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing.'

Weeks of scarcely any food since fleeing her homeland followed by platefuls of alien, inedible food forced on her at Hull, has knocked her gut for six. Judging by the frequency and intensity of the spasms Golda is experiencing, I would guess she will be staring at her feet for some time. Perhaps you should take the opportunity to consider your own impressions of Southampton. (Fear not, just as soon as Golda can stand up straight she will resume her journey to the Emigrants' Home and we shall follow.) ‘Victorian Southampton or twenty-first century Southampton?' you ask.  You can see how hard it's been to keep you in Victorian Southampton when contemporary structures such as the one before you on the corner of Albert Road, intrude.

The home is a very fine one. Here, men, women and children can restore themselves while they await their ship. In the reading room, we noticed that beside a few books, newspapers were also available. This is good. If the inhabitants of the home have to wait a day or two, what better occupation than posting themselves in the current events of the day. Doubtless those in authority would be glad if readers would take the hint and spare their old papers, magazines and books for the use of these emigrants. It would certainly be a kindly act, and one which would be highly appreciated.' Fast forward to the days following Golda's arrival, and here is Jack delivering a box of donated reading material to the reading room, wherein sits Golda, fragrant from a bath, reading Mirgorod, a collection of short stories by Nikolai Gogol (donated by Annie). While Jack pretends to arrange the donated books, Golda giggles at ‘The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich' and idly strokes her slender neck.

You see Jack climbing the wooden stairs to the second floor – stairs he's not long finished scrubbing - gripping that hideous knife of his in a manner reminiscent of the shower scene in the film Psycho (God Almighty, what an imagination you have!) You imagine that Golda's completely unaware of the danger she's in, but acknowledge (at last) that, if she knew she was home alone with Jack, she would fear for her life, sprint to the sash window, summon every ounce of her strength to throw the damn thing open, gather up the skirt of her nightdress so as not to trip on it and knock herself out (it's clearly a floor-length affair), climb onto the window ledge, step out onto the fire escape ladder that John Doling had bolted to the external wall, and shimmy down the bloody thing like a fire-fighter on a ladder test.

How the pervading smell of tar prevents us from smelling the sea!

You see her butchered corpse laid out upon a cold mortuary slab awaiting further surgical interference. I, on the other hand, see her quartered with 900 others on board the SS Paris. Since the facilities in steerage are deplorable and the air positively pestilential, I can't pretend that Golda is now free of danger (she might contract cholera.)

   "description" : "<p>It is 1895 and Jack the Ripper now lives in the City of Southampton. Newly promoted to caretaker of John Doling's Emigrants' Home in Albert Road, he spends his days fumigating the new arrivals and nights servicing prostitutes in nearby Simnel Street. For seven years he's kept his knife sheathed and his predilection for murder and dissection supressed. But with the arrival of Golda - a beautiful Russian Jewish girl fleeing from persecution in the Russian Pale – comes the reawakening of Jack's psychotic compulsions. Will Golda survive her stay at the Emigrants' Home to board the ship to take her to the New World? Or will her final destination be the cold mortuary slab? To find out, charge your smartphone, don your walking shoes and head for the City of Southampton. In ‘The Destitute and The Alien', streets you never knew existed, and likewise histories, await your exploration…</p><p>Story &copy; 2016 Tory.L.Dawson, All Rights Reserved.<br/><br/>Editors Charlie Hargood and Verity Hunt<br/><br/>Images of Canute Chambers and Simnel Street courtesy of Southampton City Council Arts and Heritage</p>",
