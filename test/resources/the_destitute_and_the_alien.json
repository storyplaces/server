  "description": "<p>It is 1895 and Jack the Ripper now lives in the City of Southampton. Newly promoted to caretaker of John Doling's Emigrants' Home in Albert Road, he spends his days fumigating the new arrivals and nights servicing prostitutes in nearby Simnel Street. For seven years he's kept his knife sheathed and his predilection for murder and dissection supressed. But with the arrival of Golda - a beautiful Russian Jewish girl fleeing from persecution in the Russian Pale – comes the reawakening of Jack's psychotic compulsions. Will Golda survive her stay at the Emigrants' Home to board the ship to take her to the New World? Or will her final destination be the cold mortuary slab? To find out, charge your smartphone, don your walking shoes and head for the City of Southampton. In ‘The Destitute and The Alien', streets you never knew existed, and likewise histories, await your exploration…</p><p>Story &copy; 2016 Tory.L.Dawson, All Rights Reserved.<br/><br/>Editors Charlie Hargood and Verity Hunt<br/><br/>Images of Canute Chambers and Simnel Street courtesy of Southampton City Council Arts and Heritage</p>",

But you must understand that it is with the proviso that, once I have moved you on from this place - for move you on I will, by force of compelling narrative rather than by any other force you may envisage – you can neither return here (for it will mean stepping outside the bounds of my story) nor continue to believe that the city of Southampton is noteworthy only for the sinking of The Titanic. Forgive me, perhaps I should have made this point altogether more pellucid when first we met at The Tudor House in Bugle Street, but I hoped our initial meeting place might have curtailed this somewhat predictable, if you do not mind my saying so, expectation of yours. And so now I find myself in the detestable position of having to warn you that, once you leave the bus-stop where now you stand (beneath its shelter if it is raining and you continue to possess the sense you were born with), you will be journeying back in time, from the year 1912 to the year 1895. However, you are not yet there. Look down at your right hand; it has been grasped by a young girl named Emily, who is a pupil at the nearby Northam Girls' School and who has just mistaken you for a relative.",

It will answer your questions far more precisely than I can. Meanwhile, I shall return to Emily as I feel sure you will once you've understood that she, together with her beloved mother and five younger siblings, are awaiting news of her father, a fireman on RMS Titanic. Perhaps, dear reader, you may be a gentleman in your thirties, with sandy-coloured hair and an impressive moustache, sporting a navy blue jacket and pale grey trousers. If so, I suspect Emily sought your hand because you reminded her of her father - a consequence of wishful thinking rather than mistaken identity. You may scan the thousand-strong crowd assembled on Canute Road to look for her. You wish you had not let go of her hand because you want to assure her, as your natural instinct dictates, that all may still be well. But of the 724 crew members from Southampton, only 175 survived the sinking to return home.

It encompasses at least one psychotic character with a penchant for anatomy, vivisection, dissection and also young women. Sound familiar? Trust me, you'll get to him later. Naturally, you hope this story has an altogether much rosier outcome (though I've already spoken about this and am not in the habit of repeating myself). I wholeheartedly comprehend your reluctance to abandon Canute Road.  You feel as if you should have done more than simply gawp at this tragic spectre of grief before turning your back on it and fiddling with your smartphone or tablet device. However, punishing yourself with one last glance at the notices tacked to the railings isn't going to improve your humour, nor alter the ending here: Emily's father has already been laid to rest in an unmarked grave in Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Alas, a trip to the Canadian maritime province to pay your respects to the non-repatriated dead isn't on the cards. This is a story propelled by legs rather than by any other form of locomotion with which you might be familiar. But rest assured that to this day, the grave of Emily's father is unstintingly tended by the good people of Nova Scotia. So, chin-up, you are in the City of Southampton. Streets that you never knew existed are about to be explored, and likewise histories. Onwards - and backwards - to 1895 or thereabouts.",

Be vigilant, dear reader: next time you observe Jack in conversation with a young and vulnerable woman, watch how he fixates on her slender neck.

If you could read Jack's thoughts as well as I can then I wouldn't have to tell you that he's already murdered Golda countless times in his mind. This is precisely how he comported himself seven years earlier. For weeks, he watched Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly go about their ‘immoral' business in the dark alleyways of Whitechapel. And from his room on Lamb street, he pictured himself ridding the streets of their filthy ways by mutilating and then murdering them before he actually got round to doing it. The ensuing man-hunt led by Detective Inspector Edmund Reid of the Metropolitan Police caused Jack to flee to Southampton. ‘Why Southampton?' you ask. I am tempted to reply, ‘Why not?'

      "content": "It's been necessary to walk back to 1893. I know you're sick and tired of the flashbacks but we must go  back to this year in order to answer your question regarding the emergence of the Emigrants' Home. So many times I've wanted to take you to a place at night but my better judgement has intervened to keep you safe. Well, no more, dear reader. You must grace Queen's Park after hours to understand why the city of Southampton needed an Emigrants' Home. Furthermore, you must summon your imagination and view this park, not as you know it (i.e. as a beautiful and tranquil place that facilitates lazy endeavours), but as the countless number of homeless emigrants who slept here in 1893, knew it. (If you find this difficult, I suggest you briefly return to 2016 and google the migrant camp in Calais nicknamed, ‘The Jungle.') In 1893, this park is barren except for the memorial to Chinese Gordon which has served for months as a reliable centre pole in that makeshift tent you see yonder, but the roof does let in the rain. If you ask that man over there - the one trying to get that meagre pile of wood aflame to warm his wife and frostbitten children - the name by which this park is known, he'll tell you it's, ‘The Number One Open Air Hotel' and not ‘Queen's Park.' Here, disease is rife, crime is too, and children witness things no child should. That's why John Doling built the Emigrants' Home.",

      "content": "It's time you met Golda. She's just one of a group of twenty-eight emigrants travelling to the Emigrants' Home today. Pity, but you missed her arrival at Southampton Docks Station. For the spotty baggage porter at least, it was quite the event. The beauty of her particular otherworldliness touched him most intimately and rendered him speechless. His inability to offer any baggage-carrying assistance to the great and the good elsewhere on the platform caused the station master's peptic ulcer to flare up. It didn't help that Golda and the other emigrants  seemed incapable of locating the exit. (Of course neither the station master nor the porter had any Russian or Yiddish, and neither Golda nor any of the others spoke a word of English. Lucky for you, dear reader, I read  thoughts as well as speaking English, police-speak and rubbish, so will be able to transcribe all that transpires in Golda's mind perfectly well.) It required a series of explicit gestures (and if you press me for further details, not all of them polite) for the station master to rid his kingdom of these emigrants. And this is where you meet Golda now, outside the station on Terminus Terrace, just after a gang of vagabonds has swaggered past her roaring, ‘Down with the Jews! Down with the Jews!' - which, incidentally, reminds me of the words Jack daubed on a Whitechapel wall minutes after he'd murdered Catherine Eddowes, ‘The Jewes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing.' Deuced peculiar.",

They are hurting something dreadful. The soles of her shoes are worn through. She may as well be trudging across the cobbles in her bare feet. And now she is bent double with a stomach cramp. Weeks of scarcely any food since fleeing her homeland followed by platefuls of alien, inedible food forced on her at Hull, has knocked her gut for six. Judging by the frequency and intensity of the spasms Golda is experiencing, I would guess she will be staring at her feet for some time. Perhaps you should take the opportunity to consider your own impressions of Southampton. (Fear not, just as soon as Golda can stand up straight she will resume her journey to the Emigrants' Home and we shall follow.) ‘Victorian Southampton or twenty-first century Southampton?' you ask.  You can see how hard it's been to keep you in Victorian Southampton when contemporary structures such as the one before you on the corner of Albert Road, intrude. (Betwixt you and I, dear reader, these ugly modern architectural excretions have caused me more than one attack of the vapours.) I have often had to consider how best to proceed. Have you ever been present when an upright elderly relative has loudly let one fly in company? Consider what might be one's reaction? The unpleasant eructation is generally ignored.",

I draw your attention to the headline, ‘More Comfort,' and the text thereunder: ‘In thus giving a passing glance at the numerous emigrants to Mr Doling's Emigrants' Home we cannot but remark upon the splendid improvement in the accommodation for them. The home is a very fine one. Here, men, women and children can restore themselves while they await their ship. In the reading room, we noticed that beside a few books, newspapers were also available. This is good. If the inhabitants of the home have to wait a day or two, what better occupation than posting themselves in the current events of the day. Doubtless those in authority would be glad if readers would take the hint and spare their old papers, magazines and books for the use of these emigrants. It would certainly be a kindly act, and one which would be highly appreciated.' Fast forward to the days following Golda's arrival, and here is Jack delivering a box of donated reading material to the reading room, wherein sits Golda, fragrant from a bath, reading Mirgorod, a collection of short stories by Nikolai Gogol (donated by Annie). While Jack pretends to arrange the donated books, Golda giggles at ‘The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich' and idly strokes her slender neck. Seconds later and hey presto, Jack the Ripper is reborn.",

You see Golda alone in her dormitory on the second floor humming Tumbalalaika to herself as she pulls a brush through her thick black hair and frets slightly about the cost of that new white nightdress she's wearing. You see Jack climbing the wooden stairs to the second floor – stairs he's not long finished scrubbing - gripping that hideous knife of his in a manner reminiscent of the shower scene in the film Psycho (God Almighty, what an imagination you have!) You imagine that Golda's completely unaware of the danger she's in, but acknowledge (at last) that, if she knew she was home alone with Jack, she would fear for her life, sprint to the sash window, summon every ounce of her strength to throw the damn thing open, gather up the skirt of her nightdress so as not to trip on it and knock herself out (it's clearly a floor-length affair), climb onto the window ledge, step out onto the fire escape ladder that John Doling had bolted to the external wall, and shimmy down the bloody thing like a fire-fighter on a ladder test. Oh, why can't Golda hear Jack's boots upon the floor, dear reader? Why can't Jack have one of his coughing fits?  I think Golda has made it on-board the SS Paris.",

Sunlight glints off the English Channel and the prevailing breeze isn't disagreeable provided you're wearing a decent hat. Close your eyes and listen to the noises of the dockyard: the honk of a ship, the shouted dialogue of the dockworkers, the thunderous clank of a heavy chain as a vessel is released of its moorings, a constable of the dock police swinging his hand rattle and bellowing for assistance – I don't know if this officer's in the process of apprehending Jack, so please don't ask - a seagull chick crying for a titbit, and a derrick loading coal. How the pervading smell of tar prevents us from smelling the sea! (I know we've smelt worse when Jack's been disinfecting the newly arrived ‘inmates' but I still feel compelled to smother my nose with your handkerchief.) Let us return to Golda. You see her butchered corpse laid out upon a cold mortuary slab awaiting further surgical interference. I, on the other hand, see her quartered with 900 others on board the SS Paris. Since the facilities in steerage are deplorable and the air positively pestilential, I can't pretend that Golda is now free of danger (she might contract cholera.) But before you and I sadly part ways, let's imagine Golda arriving in New York and being welcomed by the ‘Mother of Exiles', the Statue of Liberty. (Rest assured, dear reader, it could happen.)",
